# Boston-area Institutions of Higher Education COVID
Institutes of higher education (IHE) can play a large role in mitigating the spread of COVD-19, and this is especially true as we await large scale vaccination. Here, I have aggregated the testing numbers and case counts for institutes of higher education in Boston.

## Data and findings
This dataset resides at this [url](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YJt62E16PZkIl2ZPTUhm2fFVdRT6BKidswFKT6aIZsk/edit?usp=sharing), which I pull from in the notebook. Additionally, I briefly use the [NYT](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) county-level data.

## Limitations
The dashboard for Tufts University needs to be updated daily to get at an estimate for the daily case counts and testing, and this certainly has produced errors. Additionally, the Boston University dashboard does not provide historical testing data (past one week), so the number of tests early in the semester is off.
